** Encrypt & Decrypt Web Application **
This is a simple web-based tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Vernam Cipher. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input a message, specify a key (of the same length as the message), and either encrypt or decrypt the text.

** Features **
Vernam Cipher: The tool currently supports only the Vernam cipher, a symmetric key cipher where the key is as long as the message itself.
Encrypt/Decrypt Mode: Switch between encryption and decryption with the click of a button.
User Input: Enter the plaintext or ciphertext, along with a key.
Output Display: See the output immediately after processing the text.
Reset and Copy: Reset the fields or copy the output with the respective buttons.
Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Toggle between dark and light themes to fit your preferences.

** Technologies Used **
HTML5: Structure and content of the webpage.
CSS: Styling of the webpage.
JavaScript: Logic for encryption, decryption, and user interactions.
Google Fonts: Used for typography (Inter font).

** How to Use **
Select Cipher: Choose the cipher type from the dropdown (currently, only "Vernam" is available).
Enter Key: Input a key of the same length as your message in the "Enter key" field.
Enter Text: Type the message you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input box.
Choose Mode: Click on the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button depending on the operation you want to perform.
Process: Click the "Go" button to perform the encryption/decryption.
Reset: Use the "Reset" button to clear all fields.
Copy: Use the "Copy" button to copy the output text to your clipboard.

** Example **
Cipher: Vernam
Key: 10101
Input Text: HELLO
Encrypted Output: (will be generated based on key)
Decrypted Output: HELLO
